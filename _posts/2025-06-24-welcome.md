## ✨ Why This Portfolio?

I’ve always believed that **sharing is half the fun** of tinkering with data, mechanics and code.  
This site is my open lab bench — a place where:

* 📝 **Short bursts** of ideas live alongside deep-dive articles.  
* 🔬 Experiments (successful *and* failed!) are documented in the clear.  
* 🤝 Collaboration invitations are one click away.
