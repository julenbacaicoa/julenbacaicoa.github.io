### 🛠️ Project Overview

**VisuTrace** is a standalone visualization and analysis tool for industrial robot trajectories. It enables users to inspect joint-level data — including position, velocity, acceleration, torque, and current — for each axis of a robot. The tool is designed to support both educational use and diagnostic tasks in industrial environments.
