### üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

**SolBeam2D** is a cross-platform educational tool for structural analysis of 2D beam systems. It allows users to intuitively model nodes, beams, supports, and loads, and instantly visualize structural responses such as axial force, shear force, bending moment, and displacements.

### üîç Techniques & Features

- GUI developed in Python  
- Structural analysis via Anastruct library  
- Supports point, distributed, and moment loads  
- Real-time graphical feedback on stress and displacement  
- Project save/load in JSON format  
- Image export of structural results  
- Responsive interface scaling based on screen resolution  
- Fully packaged for Windows, Linux, and macOS

### üß† My Role

- Designed and implemented the full interface  
- Integrated input handling and model logic  
- Automated result visualization across multiple diagrams  
- Built a portable cross-platform release (Windows, Linux, macOS)  
- Designed a custom splash screen and responsive UI layout
