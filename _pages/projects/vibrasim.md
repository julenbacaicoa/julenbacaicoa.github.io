### 🛠️ Project Overview

**VibraSim** is an interactive simulation environment for visualizing vibration responses of mechanical systems, starting with single-degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) models. It combines animated dynamic behavior with signal plots to support education and intuitive understanding of vibration phenomena.

The tool is currently under **active development**, with planned support for multi-DOF systems, frequency analysis, and experimental data integration.

### 🔍 Techniques & Features

- Real-time animation of mass-spring-damper systems  
- Visualization of displacement, velocity, and acceleration  
- Support for free and forced vibrations  
- Interactive parameter input and result plots  
- Clean and scalable GUI using CustomTkinter + Matplotlib  

### 🧠 My Role

- Designed the core simulation engine for 1-DOF systems  
- Implemented animated and responsive GUI  
- Developed modular architecture for future 2-DOF/ND systems  
- Currently expanding features for education and experimentation
